# Priority Update Fix - Testing Guide

## üîß What Was Fixed

The priority update issue has been comprehensively addressed with the following improvements:

### Enhanced Field Matching Logic
- **Multiple Comparison Methods**: Exact match, case-insensitive match, and substring matching
- **Unicode Normalization**: Handles potential encoding issues between Danish and English
- **Robust Field Detection**: Checks for both "Priority" and "Prioritet" field names
- **Whitespace Handling**: Normalizes field names by trimming and removing extra spaces

### Detailed Debugging
- **Enhanced Logging**: Shows byte-level field comparison for debugging
- **User Language Context**: Logs which language the user is using
- **Field Analysis**: Lists all available fields when priority field is not found
- **Step-by-step Process**: Tracks each step of the update process

## üß™ How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Configure the Bot
1. Add your Discord bot token to `config.properties`:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token_here
   ```

### Step 2: Start the Bot
```bash
java -jar target\axion-bot-1.0.0.jar
```

### Step 3: Test Priority Update
1. Create a ticket using your bot's ticket system
2. Click the "Set Priority" button (üìä) on the welcome message
3. Select a different priority from the dropdown
4. **Expected Result**: The priority field in the embed should update immediately

## üìã What to Look For in Logs

When testing, you should see these log entries:

### ‚úÖ Successful Priority Update Logs:
```
[INFO] Attempting to update priority field 'Prioritet' for ticket TKT-xxx (user language: da)
[INFO] Retrieved 1 messages from thread for ticket TKT-xxx
[INFO] Welcome message has 1 embeds for ticket TKT-xxx
[INFO] Original embed has X fields for ticket TKT-xxx
[INFO] New priority text: 'HIGH' for ticket TKT-xxx
[INFO] Comparing field 'Prioritet' (normalized: 'Prioritet') against 'Prioritet' (normalized: 'Prioritet') for ticket TKT-xxx
[INFO] ‚úÖ Successfully matched and updated priority field 'Prioritet' for ticket TKT-xxx
[INFO] ‚úÖ Successfully updated welcome message priority for ticket: TKT-xxx
```

### ‚ùå If Priority Field Not Found (Debug Info):
```
[ERROR] ‚ùå Priority field 'Prioritet' not found in embed for ticket TKT-xxx. Available fields:
[ERROR]   - 'Ticket ID' (length: 9, bytes: [84, 105, 99, 107, 101, 116, 32, 73, 68])
[ERROR]   - 'Category' (length: 8, bytes: [67, 97, 116, 101, 103, 111, 114, 121])
[ERROR]   - 'Prioritet' (length: 8, bytes: [80, 114, 105, 111, 114, 105, 116, 101, 116])
[ERROR] Expected priority field name: 'Prioritet' (length: 8, bytes: [80, 114, 105, 111, 114, 105, 116, 101, 116])
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If the embed still doesn't update:

1. **Check the logs** for the specific error messages above
2. **Verify user language**: Make sure the user's language is correctly detected
3. **Check field names**: The debug logs will show exactly what field names are available
4. **Unicode issues**: The byte-level comparison will reveal any encoding problems

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Field name mismatch**: The enhanced matching logic now handles this automatically
2. **Language detection**: User language is now logged for each update attempt
3. **Encoding problems**: Unicode normalization and byte-level analysis help identify these
4. **Permission issues**: Make sure the user has staff permissions to change priority

## üéØ Expected Behavior

- **Immediate Update**: Priority field should change instantly when selected
- **Language Support**: Works with both English ("Priority") and Danish ("Prioritet")
- **Robust Matching**: Handles variations in spacing, case, and encoding
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides comprehensive debugging information

## üìù Technical Details

The fix is implemented in the `updateWelcomeMessagePriority` method in `TicketManager.java`:

- **Line 417**: Gets the priority field name based on user language
- **Lines 430-480**: Enhanced field matching and update logic
- **Lines 450-470**: Multiple comparison strategies for robust matching
- **Lines 475-485**: Detailed error logging with byte-level analysis

The priority update flow:
1. User clicks "Set Priority" button ‚Üí `handlePriorityTicketButton`
2. User selects priority ‚Üí `handleStringSelectInteraction`
3. Priority is updated in database ‚Üí `setTicketPriority`
4. Welcome message embed is updated ‚Üí `updateWelcomeMessagePriority`
